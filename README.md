To run the application, follow these steps:

Download the files: Download all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files provided in your question. Save them in a directory on your computer.

Setup Mock API: The JavaScript code in index.html and indexCart.html makes requests to a mock API to fetch data. You can either set up a similar mock API to respond to these requests, or you can modify the JavaScript code to fetch data from a different source (e.g., a real API or local JSON files).

Open in a web browser: After setting up the mock API or modifying the JavaScript code, you can open the index.html file in a web browser to view and interact with the application.

Interact with the application: Once the application is open in your web browser, you can navigate between the "Shop" and "Shopping Cart" pages using the navigation links. You can also interact with the shopping cart functionality by adding products to the cart and adjusting quantities.

Submit form: On the "Shopping Cart" page, you can fill out the form fields for name, email, telephone, and address. After filling out the form, you can click the "Submit" button to presumably submit the form data to a server-side endpoint (which is not implemented in the provided code).

Remember, for a complete application, you would need to implement server-side code to handle form submissions and possibly store data in a database. Additionally, you might need to adjust the JavaScript code to work with your chosen data source (e.g., a different API or local data files).
